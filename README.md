## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to play a memory game for fun, and have a overall good experience.

My wireframes created as part of the design process are made in balsamiq and can be found in the wireframes directory located in this project. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
- navigation menu which lets you choose between 3 different levels. 
- Level one consists of 12 memory cards (6 pairs) match all the cards to complete the level.
- Level one consists of 18 memory cards (9 paris) match all the cards to complete the level.
- Level three consists of 24 memory cards (12 pairs) match all the cards to complete the level.
- On each level there is a reset button present which resets the level.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- Navigation menu - allows players to navigate through the three different levels. 
- Memory game - allows the player to play a memory game by clicking on the cards and try to find a match, when a match is made, the player can move on until there are no more left. 
- Reset button - allow to player to reset the level by clicking on the reset button

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
